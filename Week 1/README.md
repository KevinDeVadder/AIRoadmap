In week 1, I will focus more on getting a recap of mathematics and start to build Tensorflow models based on tutorials and couses.
*In week 0, I have followed the course "Computational Neuroscience" on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience/) and finished week 1 of it. I will also finish week 2 of this course this week.
