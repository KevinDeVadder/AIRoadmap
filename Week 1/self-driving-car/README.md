For this project, I will be following the steps in the following article: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/run-a-self-driving-car-using-javascript-and-tensorflow-js-8b9b3f7af23d.
After succesfully completing the tutorial, I will build my own track in Unity, in order to test my knowledge.

Test 1 - Model made by using data from only the first track | Loss - 0.44 | Epochs - 10 | Works perfectly on the first track. It crashes on the second one after just 5 seconds.
