For this project, I will be following the steps in the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Js4KiDwiyU

All of the original code belongs to the creator of the tutorial and can be found on: https://github.com/Sebastian-Schuchmann/A.I.-Jumping-Cars-ML-Agents-Example

A guide to migrating MLAgents to version 2.0 can be found here: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/main/docs/Migrating.md

After succesfully completing the tutorial, I will try building a self driving car in Unity, in order to test my knowledge, and then use that car AI on the Udacity simulator tried in the last section of this week.
