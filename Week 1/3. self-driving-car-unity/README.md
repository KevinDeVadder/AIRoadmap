For this project, I want to build a self driving car on my own, using Unity ML Agents v2.0.

The whole project will be documented here and I will try to also record and upload a video of this project.
The link for the video will be posted here as well.

My initial plan for the project will be as follows:

1. Build 3D learning track for car agents
2. Manually add targets through the track for agents to get to.
3. Set observations, actions and rewards for the agent.
4. After sufficient training, compile the model and test it on the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Simulator.
